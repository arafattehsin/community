### This repo has everything which was discussed on 4th December, 2019 for Azure User Group, Sydney at Microsoft Reactor. 

I have also included Google Adapter's demo code and for the last demo where I showed you Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant, you can refer to this [sample](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/botbuilder-community-dotnet/tree/develop/samples/Cortana%20Assistant%20Alexa%20Sample) (it's an old but the new one is in the baking).

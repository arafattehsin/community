## Extending Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement with Bots
I was one of the speakers in this event and I gave an insight on how effectively bots can be used in order to accelerate your business by extending Dynamics 365 CRM with Bots and Power Platform.

This repo has everything from demo to slide deck which was discussed in the session. 

### Some notable questions

**Question # 1: Can we connect any other system with D365 Virtual Agent for Customer Service?**

**Answer:** As of now, this feature is in preview so currently you can only connect any external service/system through Microsoft Flow. In order to connect your in-house backend system or any service, you can write Custom Connectors and then connect here. 
 
 **Question # 2: You mentioned WhatsApp adapter support from Bot Builder Community project. Can we create a bot and then communicate through WhatsApp using that bot?**

**Answer:** We're building some cool stuff at [Bot Builder Community Project](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/). We've got Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa support already there for .NET stack (along with the samples). For WhatsApp, it's just being pushed on the Nodejs side. You will be able to do the similar stuff with WhatsApp and Twilio as you would do with another channel (except for some specialized controls).
